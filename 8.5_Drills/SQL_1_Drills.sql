SELECT COUNT(id) AS count_vehicles
FROM vehicles;
-- ANSWER: 33442

-- 2. Write a query that returns all the records in the vehicles table.
SELECT *
FROM vehicles;

-- 3. Write a query that returns the id, make, and model fields 
-- for all the records for 2010 vehicles.
SELECT id, make, model
FROM vehicles
WHERE year = 2010;

-- 4. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles from 2010. 
-- Also provide the answer.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year = 2010;
-- ANSWER = 1109

-- 5. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles in the vehicles table 
-- between the years 2010 and 2015, inclusive. 
-- Provide the query as well as the answer.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015;
-- ANSWER = 5995

-- 6. Write a query that returns the count of vehicles from the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. 
-- Provide the query and the result.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year IN (1990, 2000, 2010);
-- ANSWER = 3026

-- 7. Write a query that returns the count of all records between 1987 and 2005, 
-- exclusive of the years 1990 and 2000.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year BETWEEN 1987 AND 2005
	AND year != 1990 AND year != 2000;
-- ANSWER: 17235

-- 8. Write a query that returns the year, make, model, and a field called average_mpg 
-- that calculates the average highway/city fuel consumption. 
-- (For example, if hwy is 24 and cty is 20, then average_mpg = (24 + 20)/ 2 = 22.)
SELECT year, make, model, (hwy + cty)/2 AS average_mgp
FROM vehicles;

-- 9. Write a query that returns the year, make, model, and a text field displaying “X highway; Y city.” 
-- (For example, if hwy is 24 and cty is 20, then hwy_city is “24 highway; 20 city.”)
SELECT year, make, model, CONCAT(hwy, ' highway; ', cty, ' city.')
FROM vehicles;

-- 10. Write a query that returns the id, make, model, and year for all records that have NULL 
-- for either the cyl or displ fields.
SELECT id, make, model, year
FROM vehicles
WHERE cyl IS NULL 
	OR displ IS NULL;

-- 11. Write a query that returns all fields for records with rear-wheel drive 
-- and diesel vehicles since 2000, inclusive. Also sort by year and highway mileage, both descending. 
-- Hint: to view the distinct values in a field, you can use DISTINCT. 
-- For example, use SELECT DISTINCT(drive) FROM vehicles; to get the unique values 
-- that appear in that field, or use SELECT DISTINCT(fuel) FROM vehicles;.
SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE drive = 'Rear-Wheel Drive'
	AND fuel = 'Diesel'
	AND year >= 2000
ORDER BY year DESC, hwy DESC;

-- 12. Write a query that counts the number of vehicles that are either Fords or Chevrolets 
-- and either compact cars or 2-seaters. Provide the query and the answer.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE make IN ('Ford', 'Chevrolet')
	AND class IN ('Compact Cars', 'Two Seaters');
-- ANSWER = 612

-- 13. Write a query that returns the records for 10 vehicles with the highest highway fuel mileage.
SELECT *
FROM vehicles
ORDER BY hwy DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 14. Write a query that returns all the records of vehicles since the year 2000 whose model name 
-- starts with a capital X. Sort the list A through Z by make. What happens when you use a lowercase “x” instead?
SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE year >= 2000
	AND model LIKE 'X%'
ORDER BY make;
-- 469 results

SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE year >= 2000
	AND model LIKE 'x%'
ORDER BY make;
-- 40 results

-- 15. Write a query that returns the count of records where the “cyl” field is NULL. 
-- Provide the query as well as the answer.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE cyl IS NULL;
-- ANSWER: 58

-- 16. Write a query that returns the count of all records before the year 2000 
-- that got more than 20 mpg hwy and had greater than 3 liters displacement (“displ” field). 
-- Provide the query as well as the answer.
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM vehicles
WHERE year < 2000
	AND hwy > 20
	AND displ > 3;
-- ANSWER: 1964

-- 17. Write a query that returns all records whose model name has a (capital) X in its 3rd position. 
-- Hint: make sure your wildcard operator accommodates for any characters after the “X”!
SELECT *
FROM vehicles
WHERE model LIKE '__X%';
